    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: center;">
      Common questions about solar panels, installation, and our services.
    </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Can I buy solar panels without installation?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, absolutely! Installation is completely optional. You can purchase products and install them yourself, or hire your own installer. We're happy to provide guidance either way.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Does solar work during rain or cloudy weather?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, solar panels still generate power on cloudy days, though at reduced efficiency. This is why battery storage is important - batteries store excess power during sunny periods for use during low-sun periods, rain, or at night.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Is solar cheaper than generators in the long run?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes, over time solar is significantly cheaper. While the initial investment is higher, you eliminate ongoing fuel costs, maintenance is minimal, and solar systems typically last 20-25 years. Most customers see a return on investment within 3-5 years.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How many solar panels do I need for my home?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">This depends on your daily energy consumption, location, and roof space. A typical Nigerian home might need 4-8 panels (1.2kW - 2.4kW system) for basic needs. We offer free consultations to help determine the right system size for you.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How long do solar batteries last?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Quality deep-cycle batteries typically last 5-8 years with proper maintenance. Lithium batteries can last 10-15 years. Battery lifespan depends on usage patterns, depth of discharge, and maintenance. We'll help you choose the right battery for your needs.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Do you offer warranties on products?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Yes! All our products come with manufacturer warranties. Solar panels typically have 25-year warranties, inverters 2-5 years, and batteries 1-3 years depending on the brand. We'll provide full warranty documentation with your purchase.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What payment methods do you accept?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">We accept bank transfers, card payments, and cash. Online payment integration (Paystack/Flutterwave) is coming soon for secure online checkout.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How long does installation take?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Most residential installations take 1-3 days depending on system size and complexity. Commercial installations may take longer. We'll provide a timeline during the consultation phase.</div>
